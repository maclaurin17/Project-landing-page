# Project-landing-page

The Project Landing page is my second project on The Odin Projecct 


In this project, I will be creating an entire webpage from a design provided by The Odin Project. This project is supposed to test my basic CSS skills using some properties like Flexbox to design headers, footers, modals, and the page layout.
