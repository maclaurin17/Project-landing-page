       <p>It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong. Too many investors become obsessed with being right, even when the gains are small. Winning big and cutting your losses when you're wrong are more important than being right.</p>

<div class="quote">
    <div> It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for. If you're a millionaire by the time you're 30 but blow it all by age 40, you've gained nothing. Grow and protect your investment portfolio by carefully diversifying it, and you may find yourself funding many generations to come.</div>
